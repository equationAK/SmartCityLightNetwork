# Design and Development of a "Smart Lamppost" for Public Lighting in a Smart City Environment

## Abstract
This thesis deals with the design and development of a network of "smart columns" of public lighting in a smart city environment. The implementation of the systems is based on the combination of the capabilities, offered by the Arduino, ESP32 and Raspberry development platforms in combination with the use of sensors. The communication between them is based on the standards of wired and wireless local area networks and the use of internet protocols. The movement of information, from the collection of sensor data, is based on the communication network implemented and its storage is done using databases on a central server as well as an Internet of Things (IoT) remote access platform. The ultimate goal is to build a network of lighting columns, which will collect data from the surrounding space, manage autonomous interaction scenarios such as managing public lighting, collecting information of the surrounding space using various application In this thesis, an attempt is made to present all the building blocks used in the implementation of the systems, as well as the technologies studied and combined in order to effectively analyse the data collection and its visualisation. Technologies related to the communications used, with the databases, the web (MySQL, Apache Web Server, PHP, JS) and the web data exchange formats (XML, JSON) are analysed. A presentation is also made of the 3D printing technology (3D print) used to create parts of the implementation systems. On the software side, the programming languages used in the programming of the microcontrollers (C++, microPython), in the implementation of the database (JAVA, PHP, SQL) and in the interface with the web pages (PHP, JavaScript, Html, CSS) are presented. Finally, reference is made to studies on the development of a smart grid for public lighting.

## Introduction
The smart lamppost system addresses the evolving needs of urban environments by integrating IoT technologies to improve public lighting efficiency and offer citizens valuable environmental insights. This project serves as a comprehensive approach to understanding and leveraging smart city infrastructure.

## Background
Using a combination of Arduino, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi, the smart lamppost system relies on sensor data for automated lighting adjustments, environmental monitoring, and communication protocols such as Wi-Fi, LoRa, and Xbee for real-time data management.

## Methodology
The design includes data gathering from sensors, such as temperature, humidity, gas levels, UV light, and noise. These sensors communicate with each other and a central database to provide automated responses based on predefined conditions, improving energy efficiency and safety.

## Results
The smart lamppost system demonstrated significant potential for energy savings and data accuracy, with interactive features accessible via a web interface. The system's flexibility supports a variety of data types and real-time visualizations using technologies like MySQL, PHP, and Google Charts.

## Conclusion
This project underscores the benefits of incorporating IoT technologies in urban infrastructure, contributing to the sustainable development of smart cities. The system offers a scalable solution that can integrate additional features, enhancing its utility.

## Future Work
Future improvements could include integrating machine learning for predictive analytics, expanding the sensor range, and enhancing data visualization methods to provide richer insights for urban planning.
